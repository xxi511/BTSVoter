# BTS Voter
A chrome extension to auto vote to BTS in 2019 Billboard Music Awards 

## How to use    
### Open execute.js    
Replace your e-mail in line 1    
every e-mail can vote 100 times a day, but click 100 times is kind of silly :)    
make `cheatMode = true` to auto vote    
```javaScript
var mail = "YOUR_MAIL";
var cheatMode = false;
```

then install this extension

enjoy ~
